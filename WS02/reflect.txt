Doing this workshop has really made me understand how to dynamically allocate merory well.In the customer .cpp file of DIY i was able to fynamically alloctae memory in the add customer function which i later on deallocated.I had an error at the beginning because i did not deallocate memory .But i was able to fix it and moving forward i will always deallocate every memory at the end inorder to avoid memory leaks
